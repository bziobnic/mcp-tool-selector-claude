# AI-Specific Notes for MCP Tool Selector

## Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **Python**: Chosen for cross-platform compatibility and ease of development
- **Tkinter**: Selected as the GUI framework because it's included in the Python standard library, ensuring no additional dependencies are needed for basic functionality
- **JSON**: Using Python's built-in json module for configuration file management

### Architecture

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern**:
  - Model: `config_manager.py` and `tool_manager.py` handle data and business logic
  - View: UI components in the `ui/` directory handle presentation
  - Controller: `app.py` connects the model and view components

- **Modular Design**: Components are separated into distinct modules to facilitate testing and maintenance

### Error Handling Strategy

- Comprehensive error handling for file operations
- Validation of user input, especially for JSON parsing
- Clear error messages displayed to the user
- Logging of errors for debugging purposes

## Implementation Considerations

### JSON Configuration Management

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration files
- Implement proper JSON schema validation for tool definitions
- Handle special characters and encoding issues in configuration files

### UI/UX Design

- Use clear visual indicators for enabled/disabled tools
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Include tooltips and help text for better usability

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Mock objects for file system operations
- Test cases for error handling scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize file reading/writing operations
- Implement lazy loading for large configuration files
- Use efficient data structures for tool management

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks
- Handle sensitive information in configuration files (like credentials) securely
- Implement proper file permissions for configuration files

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple configuration files
- Advanced filtering and searching of tools
- Theming support (light/dark mode)
- Internationalization support
- Command-line interface for automation

## Development Workflow

- Implement core functionality first
- Add UI components incrementally
- Continuously test during development
- Refactor code as needed to maintain clean architecture
